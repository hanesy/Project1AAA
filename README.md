Project 1 (January 2020); UC Berkeley Data and Analytics Bootcamp  

### Large Source Data File from Kaggle
The source data file is not included in the github as it is a large file.  It can be accessed directly from kaggle (see link below).

### This project seeks to answer the following questions about car accidents in the United States.  

1. Have car accidents increased over time?
2. Where do the highest number of accidents occur, and where do the most severe accidents occur?
3. When do the highest number of accidents occur?
4. Under what weather conditions do accidents occur?
5. Is there any correlation between different traffic infrastructure and frequency of accidents? Between street direction and accidents?
